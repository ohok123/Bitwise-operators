# Bitwise-operators
# this project is to implement a set of operations supported by a menu that will prompt for the operation (“Count Leading Zeros”, “Endian Swap”, “Rotate Right”, and “Parity”) along with one integer, inclusively, and then perform that operation on the input integer to produce the result.
